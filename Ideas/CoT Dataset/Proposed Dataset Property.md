##### Context-Based Perception
- An equilateral triangle can either be interpreted as equilateral_triangle or as convex, depending on other contextual images
##### Analogy Making Perception or [Conceptual slippage](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-34422-0_2)
- Shape analogy - A circle is to a sphere as a square is to a cube
- Functional analogy Spoon is to bowl as fork is to plate
- Spatial configuration Books on shelf is to office as plates on rack is to kitchen
- Color/form mapping Green leaves is to tree as red petals is to flower
- Object-role  Police car is to traffic as ambulance is to hospital
##### Visual Metaphor Comprehension
-  Image of a ladder with people climbing labeled “career growth.”Ask: _“What does this image mean metaphorically?”_
##### Visual Memory ( Recalling visual stimuli after brief exposure )
- Like PAM
##### Confounding concepts in Images
- Given a pair of images 
##### Recursive Structures Detection  (Strange Loops) [[GEB Hoffstadter]]
- a person drawing a picture of a person drawing a picture or like triangle fractals

#### [Bistable perception](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.19423v1) or Figure Ground ambiguity or more genrally Perspective Shift (BiStable, Multistable etc) :
- like rubins vase

##### Perspective Taking
- Understanding what a scene looks like from another viewpoint (spatial or social) What can the person behind the box see? From this angle, which object is hidden? What would person A assume is happening here? 

#### Abstraction Trajectory Prediction ( Bongard Turns )
- so like a mix of identifying turn problems in bongard, Mind the gap path plans, or like spatial navigation. 
##### Ego centric and allocentric perception ( Frame of reference switching ) 
##### Spatial affordance
- If I am standing near the table can i reach the cuboard
##### Spatio-temporal reasoning
- If the ball is roling from left to right. If i remove the 
##### Multi-rule compositional reasoning
##### Multi-step compositional reasoning

##### Mental Rotation
- Mind the gap asks for similarity. we ask for what is the rotations needed to convert one object into another.
##### Free form answers
- Most datasets have like options to chose from which can lead to issues as mention by MMReason. For our task can we do like free form answers for evaluations

##### Visual isomorphism detection :
- Recognizing structural similarity between different domains or formats
- like A seesaw and a balance equation. and questions like Which of these images shares the same structure as the top image? or Identify the diagram that is isomorphic to the given network.

##### visual closure
- Like do you see me, instead of figures and we identify the salient region of an image for atask and then obscure certain part of the salient image to see if the task can be completed or not.
   
##### Perspective Reasoning
- Present ambiguous or flattened drawings and test the model's ability to reason about spatial depth and camera viewpoint. like if i give drawing of circle and ask looking from any other perspective what would the object look like cylinder, Qube, pyramid or sphere. answer, sphere and cylinder

##### Topological Reasoning:
- 
##### Bongard Problems
- Can we use Bongard-LOGO and Bongard-HOI and get only the tough probelms after evaluating bu VLMs like MMReason
- Can we think in some ways to include bongard problems concepts in natural images in this dataset or like
