##### Context-Based Perception
- An equilateral triangle can either be interpreted as equilateral_triangle or as convex, depending on other contextual images
##### Analogy Making Perception
- Shape analogy - A circle is to a sphere as a square is to a cube
- Functional analogy Spoon is to bowl as fork is to plate
- Spatial configuration Books on shelf is to office as plates on rack is to kitchen
- Color/form mapping Green leaves is to tree as red petals is to flower
- Object-role  Police car is to traffic as ambulance is to hospital
##### Visual Metaphor Comprehension
-  Image of a ladder with people climbing labeled “career growth.”Ask: _“What does this image mean metaphorically?”_
##### Visual Memory ( Recalling visual stimuli after brief exposure )
- Like PAM
##### Confounding concepts in Images
- Given a pair of images 
##### Recursive Structures Detection
- a person drawing a picture of a person drawing a picture or like triangle fractals
##### Prespective shifts

#### [Bistable perception](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.19423v1):
- like rubins vase

##### Perspective Taking

#### Abstraction Trajectory Prediction ( Bongard Turns )
##### Ego centric and allocentric perception ( Frame of reference switching ) 
##### Spatial affordance
- If I am standing near the table can i reach the cuboard
##### spatio-temporal reasoning
- If
##### Multi-rule compositional reasoning
##### Multi-step compositional reasoning

##### Mental Rotation
- Mind the gap asks for similarity. we ask for what is the rotations needed to convert one object into another.
##### Free form answers
- Most datasets have like options to chose from which can lead to issues as mention by MMReason. For our task can we do like free form answers for evaluations

##### [Conceptual slippage](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-34422-0_2)
- we show the image pair of pen->paper and then give another image of a frying pan and ask what object would it be to. So basically what a->b :  c-> ?
##### Figure Ground ambiguity
##### Analogy based

##### Perception Shift

##### metaphor comprehension

##### isomorphism detection

##### visual closure

##### Confounding concepts

##### Path Planning

##### Bongard Problems
- Can we use Bongard-LOGO and Bongard-HOI and get only the tough probelms after evaluating bu VLMs like MMReason
- Can we think in some ways to include bongard problems in this dataset
