##### Context-Based Perception
- An equilateral triangle can either be interpreted as equilateral_triangle or as convex, depending on other contextual images
##### Analogy Making Perception
- Shape analogy - A circle is to a sphere as a square is to a cube
- Functional analogy Spoon is to bowl as fork is to plate
- Spatial configuration Books on shelf is to office as plates on rack is to kitchen
- Color/form mapping Green leaves is to tree as red petals is to flower
- Object-role  Police car is to traffic as ambulance is to hospital
##### Visual Metaphor Comprehension
-  Image of a ladder with people climbing labeled “career growth.”Ask: _“What does this image mean metaphorically?”_
##### Visual Memory ( Recalling visual stimuli after brief exposure )
- Like PAM
##### Confounding concepts in Images
- Given a pair of images 
##### Recursive Structures Detection
- a person drawing a picture of a person drawing a picture or like triangle fractals
##### Prespective shifts
