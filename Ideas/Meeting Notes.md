Build multi reasoning reasoning steps on existing datatsets.

Train the model with loss/rewards on the intermediate steps of reasoning and the final reward of the final asnwer

USe the existing dataset, to generate plans/intermediate steps using the LLMs. check to see of they are good enough.

Generate visual plans from the LLM. Also generate the text plans and check if the texts plans and the visual plans are grounded and they align or not.


Can we replan or re think the thought process in LLM. check RL space where we rethink trajectories

Reasoning models in teaching videos ( like lecture videos )

look at all types of dataset so that we can come up with something for multi step reasoning.

create a small dataset for visual process grounding. i.e. not LLM generated intermediate steps for resoning in vLLM


can we use BLINK, Spatial457 etc to see if these RL based visual reasoning models are failing where so that we can see where these models are failing. good analysis paper.

create a table for all Spatial dataset and the dimension of visual perception they are covering. so that we can see the gap.
